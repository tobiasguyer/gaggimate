/**
 * Transport-agnostic protocol session.
 *
 * Owns the outbound coalescing queue and implements reliable delivery on top of
 * a datagram Transport:
 *
 *   - send() enqueues a Payload; the send pump drains the highest-priority
 *     entries into one Frame, stamps a monotonic id, and transmits it.
 *   - A frame stays "in flight" (and is retransmitted on timeout) until the
 *     peer ACKs its id; only then is the next frame sent. This is what keeps a
 *     message effectively in the queue until acknowledged.
 *   - Incoming frames are de-duplicated by id (so retransmits are safe even for
 *     non-idempotent ops) and ACKed; payloads are dispatched by oneof tag to
 *     typed handlers -- no run-time type erasure.
 *
 * Threading: decode + ACK/dedup + the send pump run on the transport's callback
 * thread, but registered handlers and connection callbacks are invoked on a
 * dedicated dispatch task (fed by an inbound event queue) so slow application
 * callbacks never block the BLE host task. Serializing both event types also
 * prevents payload handlers from crossing a connection-session boundary. If
 * the inbound queue is full the frame is left un-ACKed, which
 * back-pressures the sender into retransmitting. Queue + in-flight state are
 * guarded by a mutex; handlers run with the mutex released, so a handler may
 * call send() re-entrantly.
